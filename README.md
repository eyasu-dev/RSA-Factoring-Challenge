# RSA Factoring Challenge

The RSA Factoring Challenge is a computational challenge to factorize a given RSA modulus into its two prime factors. The challenge was introduced in 1991 and lasted until 2007. During this time, several RSA moduli of increasing bit lengths were published for the public to try and factorize.

## Challenge Details

The RSA Factoring Challenge moduli are expressed in decimal form and consist of a semiprime (the product of two prime numbers). The challenge is to factorize the semiprime and provide the two prime factors. The moduli are given in the following format:

For example, RSA-2048-1 is the first challenge with a 2048-bit semiprime expressed in hexadecimal format.
